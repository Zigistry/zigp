To install run:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zigistry/zigp/main/install_script.sh -sSf | sh
```

### What all can this do right now?

#### Adding a package to your zig project:

```bash
zigp add gh/<owner-name>/<repo-name>

# Example:
zigp add gh/capy-ui/capy
```

#### Updating your zig project's build.zig.zon following zigp.zon:

```bash
zigp update all
```

Update a specific dependency:
```bash
zigp update --specific zorsig
```

#### Removing a package from zigp.zon as well as build.zig.zon:

```bash
zigp remove <package-name>

# Example:
zigp remove zorsig
```


#### Installing a program as a binary file (This will also export it to your $PATH):

```bash
zigp install gh/<owner-name>/<repo-name>

# Example:
zigp install gh/zigtools/zls
```

#### Seeing info of a specific repository

```bash
zigp info gh/<owner-name>/<repo-name>

# Example:
zigp info gh/zigtools/zls
```
#### Self updating zigp to the latest version

```bash
zigp self-update
```

### Release based version management:
"^x.y.z" Allowing updates that don't change the left most 0.
"~x.y.z" Allow patch updates within same minor version.
"==x.x.x" Fixed version, no changes.
"*" Any latest available version allowed.
"x.y.z...a.b.c" updates within x.y.z and a.b.c range (both inclusive).
"|tag_name" If a release not following semver rules, and zigp is unable to parse it as a semver, the tag_name would be added after a |. No updates, version remains fixed.

### Branch based version management:
"%master" will update to latest commit at master branch.
"==%master" No changes.
